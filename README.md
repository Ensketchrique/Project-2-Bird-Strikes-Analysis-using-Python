Bird Strike Analysis for Aviation Safety
This project analyzes FAA bird strike data (2000-2011) to understand patterns, high-risk areas, and cost implications in aviation safety. Using Python, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the analysis visualizes bird strike trends, affected airlines and airports, timing, altitude, and phases of flight where strikes are most common.
